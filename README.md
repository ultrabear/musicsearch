# MusicSearch
A basic program that indexes songs (and someday albums) in folders you specify and allows you to search on them and click on them right from the terminal using file hyperlinks\

This is far from complete, and the full concept for what this may become in the future is undecided, it was originally made because fb2k has a music search and deadbeef does not, but it is not decided if this will evolve into a deadbeef plugin in the future.
